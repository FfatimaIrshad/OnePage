              <h3>The Psychologist Reputation Repair Story</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">
                We are talented S.E.O., Social Media & Marketing Experts with several teams of very creative Developers and ex-Google employees, we have been doing Online Reputation Repair for over 6 years
              </p>
              <p>
                After a while it became obvious that mental health professionals were particularly vulnerable to online reputation damage because anyone with a grudge can file a complaint with a State Psychology Board, often out of spite, and there is nothing you can do.
              </p>
              <p>
                In many cases the end result is that the psychologist's reputation is severely damaged online... forever.
               </p>
              <p>
                This is extremely unfair, so we formed Psychologist Reputation Repair to help. We specialize in restoring the online reputation of psychiatrists, psychologists & other mental health professionals.

                  Thank goodness for Psychologist Reputation Repair, I had several unkind Yelp reviews so my practice was being negatively impacted, but these guys jumped in fixed everything, they even got Yelp to delete the false reviews from their website. Psychologist Reputation Repair is very highly recommended.

                  I had an relatively minor "Administrative" Board Action (license lapsed) in one state that ended up with another action in my current state and this stuff spun way out of control. The end result was I had multiple board actions published all over the internet because of a simple oversight, it was horrible. But Psychologist Reputation Repair was able to get this stuff off of the websites for me. I appreciate the work they have done, thank you.

                  Yes, we can even get them completely deleted (depending on the context of the review(s) and which websites they are on (we have done this for many clients, in one case we got 192 very negative reviews completely deleted form 6 different websites).

                  Unfortunately psychologists are prohibited by ethics standards to try and counter negative reviews, responding would "acknowledge" that the reviewer is a current or former client, which would violate APA’s Ethical/Privacy Standard 4.01 – Maintaining Confidentiality. Also APA's Ethical Standard 5.05 - Testimonials: prohibits psychologists from soliciting testimonials. This is extremely unfair, and we do not have these restrictions. Also, all review websites have special rules and procedures for review removal, if you request a removal without knowing all the criteria, the reviews will be flagged and further deletion requests denied - We have extensive experience with all these procedures and we know exactly how to get negative reviews completely deleted.

Over 85% of people look up their providers online at some point, most likely your clients or potential clients will see the information. But how do you know which of your patients, friends, or associates have seen it? It has been our experience that they don't always tell you that they know about it, they will either: <u style="color: red;">A</u>. Alter their perception of you, or <u style="color: red;">B</u>. Just cancel the service or distance themselves without saying anything. Either way, unfavorable information can have a significant negative impact on your professional reputation, your personal relationships, and your psychology practice.

                  <li class="special"> <u>Monthly fees</u> - They will only do enough work each month to keep you paying more. They have no incentive to actually repair your reputation.</li>
                  <li class="special"><u>Annual Contracts</u> - Up to $15,000.00 per year: Same as Monthly Fees, they only do enough work to keep you paying.</li>
                  <li class="special"><u>Under Pricing</u> - Some companies will quote you a lower price with no guarantee, so they can come back and keep charging you more, and more, and it never ends.</li>
                  <li class="special"><u>Free Quotes</u> - These are basically an extortion scam, they get you to submit your personal information and they will quote you a price based on how "embarrassing" or damaging the information is rather than how much it will actually cost to remove.</li>

                <p>
                  Some state Psychology Boards have adopted unfair regulations that can result in a psychologist being disciplined or sanctioned for non-health related offenses, such as late payment of dues, "continuing education", or some states even sanction psychologists if they do not file state taxes on time.. Is this damaging your reputation? Well... we have found that this can be subjective; while most people may think "it's not a big deal", some people may "assume" facts that are not present such as "Why" did they not take care of this"? or " Something else must be going on"?, etc. - So it is up to you if you want to do something about the information or not. We can get rid of it if you want.
